<h1>Zero&#8209;Knowledge &amp; Crypto Art</h1>
<p>This page explores how zero&#8209;knowledge proofs might one day accompany the pixel sorcery on the main page.</p>
<p>Zero&#8209;knowledge proofs let you demonstrate possession of certain information without sharing the information itself. In a crypto context, this can confirm authenticity while keeping secrets safe.</p>
<p>Imagine the artwork being generated from a hidden seed. A proof could verify that the image truly came from that seed without revealing what the seed was. Collectors would know the piece is genuine, yet the mystery of the seed stays intact.</p>
<p>Today the canvas simply renders. Tomorrow it might carry such a proof, quietly embedded, linking art and cryptography.</p>
